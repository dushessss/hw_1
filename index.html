  <p>Black tea (also literally translated as red tea from various East Asian languages) is a type of tea that is more
    oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas.<br /> Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other
    teas. <br />All
    five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also
    used rarely.</p>
  <h2>Green Tea</h2>

  <p>Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same
    withering and oxidation process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas.<br /> Green tea originated in
    China, and
    since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.<br />
    Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing
    conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.</p>
